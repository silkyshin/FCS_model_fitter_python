### FCS_predictor
This repo contains scripts to solve ODEs of oligomerization pathways and predict what their FCS values G0 and τ would be.

Read the README in the ODE directory.
To predict with different oligomerization models, copy the format of the model scripts.

# Installation
'''
git clone https://github.com/silkyshin/FCS_Predictor.git
'''

# Usage
'''
python ODEsolver.py --model 'path/to/model.py'
python FCS_predictor.py --csv 'path/to/csv' --sfactor 'scaling factor'
'''

# Hydrodynamic radius, therefore diffusion time, scales as such:
Rh_n=Rh_1*n^v
Rh_n - hydrodynamic radius of n-mer
Rh_1 - hydrodynamic radius of monomer
n - number of monomers in n-mer
v - scaling factor

# Typical scaling factor values
Folded proteins - 0.3-0.35
Molten globules - 0.38-0.45
Compact IDPs - 0.4-0.45
Theta conditions - 0.5
Expanded IDPs (expanded chain) - 0.55-0.6
Amyloid fibrils - 0.9-1
